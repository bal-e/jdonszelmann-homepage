    You might not have considered this before, but tests in Rust are rather magical.
    Anywhere in your project you can slap `#[test]` on a function and the compiler makes sure that they're all automatically run.
    This pattern, of wanting access to items that are distributed over a crate and possibly even multiple crates, doesn't just come up when dealing with tests,
    but it's not something that Rust supports except for tests specifically.

If you've written a benchmark using criterion before, you may have seen this pattern:
```rust
fn criterion_benchmark(c: &mut Criterion) {
    c.bench_function("benchmark_1", benchmark_1);
    c.bench_function("benchmark_2", benchmark_2);
    c.bench_function("benchmark_3", benchmark_3);
    // ...
    c.bench_function("benchmark_n", benchmark_n);
}

criterion_group!(benches, criterion_benchmark);
criterion_main!(benches);
```

Being explicit has upsides, but it would be very cool if you could instead write:

```rust

#[bench]
fn benchmark_1(b: &mut Bencher) {}

#[bench]
fn benchmark_2(b: &mut Bencher) {}

#[bench]
fn benchmark_3(b: &mut Bencher) {}

// ...

#[bench]
fn benchmark_n(b: &mut Bencher) {}

// magically finds all the #[bench] functions
// even when they're spread over multiple files
criterion_main!();
```

This same pattern is also useful for 
registering routes for a webserver, 
[filters for tracing](https://github.com/rust-lang/testing-devex-team/issues/3#issuecomment-2112822128),
or even for defining commmand line flags.
Personally, I've had a need for this while I was testing embedde code.
There, you don't have access to rust's built-in test framework.
Interestingly, Rust does have a weird kind of support for this through [`#![feature(custom_test_frameworks)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/custom-test-frameworks.html).
I've even recommended it to my students once or twice, who wanted to test their embedded software but it always felt a bit painful as this feature will, at least in its current form, never be stable.

Various people have expressed interest in having a generic system built into the compiler that can provide this behavior.
At [RustNL](https://2024.rustnl.org), I talked to <Gh name="epage" /> who wants this for the [Testing Devex team](https://github.com/rust-lang/testing-devex-team), 
exactly to make tests less magical and to provide users with the option to define their own test frameworks.
Since then, I've been thinking about this feature. 
It started with a [pre-rfc](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/global-registration-a-kind-of-pre-rfc/20813/26), and at this point I've written most of an implementation.
I'm just not 100% sure that that's the implementation we should want anymore.

Why? Well that's what the rest of this blog post is about.

# Library Solutions

There are currently two libraries that can help you achieve global registration, both of which are maintained by <Gh name="dtolnay" />.
Let's discuss them briefly.

## Inventory

[Inventory](https://docs.rs/inventory/latest/inventory/) works using *global constructors*.
These are special functions that are called before main is by the operating system - the exact mechanism differs a bit from platform to platform.
C++ uses these to run constructors for global variables, and in rust you can use them using the [ctor](https://docs.rs/ctor/latest/ctor/).
If you would like to know more, I rather liked [this blog post](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-11-07-init-ctors-init-array) about them.

What happens, is that before main, 
a small bit of code runs for each element that needs to be registered, 
to atomically add itself to a global linked list.
Collecting happens based on the type of the item that's being collected.
I adapted the example from their docs to show what's going on:

```rust
pub struct Flag {
    short: char, name: &'static str,
}

inventory::submit! {
    Flag::new('v', "verbose")
}
// ====== generates rougly ========
// linked list node
static NODE: ... = Node::new(/* the flag */);
// runs when the program starts before main
#[cfg(link_section = ".text.startup")]
unsafe extern "C" fn __ctor() {
    // where T: Collect
    unsafe { add_to_registry::<T>(NODE); }
}
// ================================

inventory::collect!(Flag);
// ====== generates rougly ========
impl Collect for Flag {
    fn registry() -> Registry {
        // A registry is a linked list
        // this is what the add_to_registry function adds to 
        static REGISTRY: ... = Registry::new();
        &REGISTRY
    }
}
// ================================

fn main() {
    // iterate through the linked list 
    // which was built just before main started
    for flag in inventory::iter::<Flag> {
        println!("-{}, --{}", flag.short, flag.name);
    }
}
```

Inventory works as promised, and can be quite useful. 
Also, it deals well with dynamic library loading.
However, it requires running code before main, and it doesn't work on all platforms; notably embedded platforms don't really work.

## Linkme

An alternative to inventory is [linkme](https://docs.rs/linkme/latest/linkme/). 
It comes with slightly different platform support, there are even some test for a cortex-m target, and does not involve running code before main.
It works all at compile time, though most of the magic happens during linking.
Again, adapting the example from the docs:

```rust
use linkme::distributed_slice;

// all the elements ultimately "appear" here
#[distributed_slice]
pub static BENCHMARKS: [fn(&mut Bencher)];

// adds to the static above
// by placing this in a specific linker section
#[distributed_slice(BENCHMARKS)]
static BENCH_DESERIALIZE: fn(&mut Bencher) = bench_deserialize;
fn bench_deserialize(b: &mut Bencher) {}

// tries to generate a linker section that contains:
// __SPECIAL_START_SYMBOL
// &BENCH_DESERIALIZE
// ... more elements
// __SPECIAL_END_SYMBOL
```
Now, the memory between the special start and end symbol form a contiguous range of memory, 
a slice, containing each of the elements that were added. 
This works without running code before main, though dynamic library loading isn't really supported.

At this point, an obvious reaction is:

# Why don't we put this in the compiler?

If the compiler could generate this kind of distributed slice, the issue of platform support disappears.
This is basically how libtest works.
So, after [talking about it on internals.rust-lang.org](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/global-registration-a-kind-of-pre-rfc/20813) 
I enthousiasicaly added what is essentially linkme to the compiler.
The implementation even considers the possibility of some day supporting dynamic linking if Rust ever starts properly doing that.

> Note, in past discussions this feature was often called "distributed slice". 
> That's also the name of the version from the linkme crate.
> I renamed it because it being specifically a slice exposes too much of the internal working of the feature,
> and it removes a lot of flexibility to change the design later.

```rust
#![feature(global_registration)]

use core::global_registration::{global_registry, register, Registry};

#[global_registry]
static ERROR_MSGS: Registry<&str>;

register!(ERROR_MSGS, "a");
register!(ERROR_MSGS, "b");

fn main() {
    for msg in ERROR_MSGS {
        println!("{}", msg);
    }
}
```
One crate defines a registry, with `#[global_registry]`; 
anyone can add to it and in the final binary a static appears that, when iterated over, contains all the elements. Neat!

Of course, I acted first and only then thought about it properly...
After lots of incredibly helpful discussion with <Gh name="m-ou-se"/>, 
we realised that this has a lot of implications.

## The implications

Let's do some thought experiments:

1. If a registry is public, should anyone be able to add to it? Does `pub` mean read or write access?
   On a related note, does `pub use` forward this read and/or write access?
2. If there are two *different* versions of a crate that defines a global registry.
   Say, v0.1.0 and v0.2.0, should these registries be merged? 
   Okay, maybe not, but the registry was supposed to be shared between crates but now we get two disjoint registries with the same name, 
   and people generally think they're adding to the same global set of elements because the identifier is the same.
3. If the compiler implements this feature, why is the information only available at runtime?
   What stops us from collecting registered elements to a `const`?
4. Let's say you made a mistake with the type of your registy, and you want to change it in a way that's not a breaking change.
   Are there any upgrade paths?
5. Let's think of a usecase. A custom testing framework. The framework defines a registry of tests, and in your crate you add to it.
   Some dependency of yours uses the same version of the same test framework. When you run your tests, should the tests of the dependency also run?
   If the list is truely global, that's what'd happen, but it's not consistent with what libtest currently does.
6. Okay, that's silly. Each crate should get its own crate-local registry of tests. 
   The custom test framework could maybe expose a macro that creates it.
   Can you actually think of any good usecases where the registry should be truely global?

This last question we were stuck on for a little bit. 
Custom test frameworks are usually crate-local.
A benchmarking framework too.
The routes for a webserver probably as well.
Maybe you'd have a crate that adds some extra routes, which you'd then have to import for side effect to actually access them.

```rust
// just mention the crate so the globally 
// registered routes are actually implicitly added
extern crate my_extra_routes;
```

I believe that the expected globalness of global registration, 
i.e. the fact that it can implicitly collect information from any crate in the dependency tree,
mostly stems from the fact that that was the only obvious way to implement the feature before.

# An alternative design

An alternative to 


Inter-crate applications:

* Embedded tests might also want to test dependencies
    * This works with concat_registry!
* Interrupt handlers: Hal defines a registry, anyone can define handlers that should run when the interrupt happens, the hal calls these.
    * You really want this to be global
* libraries providing test fixtures
    * This works with concat_registry!
* Hayley's metrics
    * This works under concat_registry! but apparently gives a lot of overhead as there are many crates.
* Server Routes 
    * This works under concat_registry!


Problems:
* versioning of global registries
* semver
* import for side effects
* no errors when addition fails: lint?
* visibility:
    * write implying read is likely fine
    * read implying write is not, but you can solve this with a public getter
    * Not an issue with concat_registry!


```rust
use custom_test_framework::test_main;

fn main() {
    #[cfg(test)]
    test_main!()
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use custom_test_framework::custom_test;

    #[custom_test]
    fn test_a() {}

    #[custom_test]
    fn test_b() {}
}
```

What should this become? What identifier should the global registry get?
Would you need a separate 

```rust
use custom_test_framework::{test_main, define_test_registry};

define_test_registry!()

// rest of the previous example ...
```

It would be nice if `#[custom_test]` could expand to 

```rust
registry_add!(custom_test_framework::TESTS, test_{n})
```
That would mean that you should be able to add to registries *outside* the current crate *and yet* that other crate can't access the elements you add to it.
People find that confusing.

Need compile time lists for this;
We first need to have those before this design can work.
